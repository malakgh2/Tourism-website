                <h2>All time favourite place</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Tunis (Arabic: تونس‎ About this soundTūnis) is the capital and largest city of Tunisia. The greater metropolitan area of Tunis, often referred to as "Grand Tunis", has about 2,700,000 inhabitants. As of 2020, it is the fourth-largest city in the Maghreb region (after Casablanca, Algiers and Tripoli) and the sixteenth-largest in the Arab world.

Situated on a large Mediterranean Sea gulf (the Gulf of Tunis), behind the Lake of Tunis and the port of La Goulette (Ḥalq il-Wād), the city extends along the coastal plain and the hills that surround it. At its core lies its ancient medina, a World Heritage Site. East of the medina through the Sea Gate (also known as the Bab el Bhar and the Porte de France) begins the modern city, or Ville Nouvelle, traversed by the grand Avenue Habib Bourguiba (often referred to by media and travel guides as "the Tunisian Champs-Élysées")..</p>

                        <h3>Top destination</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>If you're looking for things to do and places to visit off the tourist trail, head north along the coast from Tunis to Bizerte.

Although Bizerte is one of Tunisia's industrial centers with a bustling modern port, at its core, rimming the canal, is a small maze of a medina (old town), where you're likely to be the only visitor strolling the alleys.

A Bizerte visit is a good option for travelers looking to catch a peek of Tunisian local life. The workaday atmosphere within the souk, and squat sugar-cube houses lining the waterfront, provide a good contrast with the more tourist-oriented coastal Tunisian towns to the south.

There's still beach time to be had here, though, if that's your thing.</p>
