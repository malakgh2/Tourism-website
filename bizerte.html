                    <h2>Medina Bizerte</h2>
                    <p>On the south side of the vieux port, directly opposite the kasbah, is the smaller, golden-stoned fort of Sidi el Hani.

Like the kasbah, it is an Ottoman construction and dates from the 17th century.

It has been restored to an excellent level and houses a small but interesting oceanographic museum (Musée Océanographique).

If you climb the stairs to the fort terrace there are excellent sightseeing views across town, with the vieux port and the kasbah in the foreground.

                    <h2>Fort Sidi el Hani</h2>
                    <p>The kasbah district lies just on the north side of the vieux port.

Its walls allow you fine views of the old harbor if you climb to the top.
The kasbah's interior is occupied by houses and contains a 17th-century Hanafite mosque.
Its fortifications sit on foundations that began life as a 6th century Byzantine fort, but the building works were constructed during the 17th century under Ottoman rule..</p>

                    <h2>Rebaa Mosque</h2>
                    <p>Sitting between the medina's souks and the old harbor is the 17th-century Rebaa Mosque.

This distinctive Bizerte landmark has an octagonal minaret that has obvious Ottoman design influence on its gallery facade.

If you're seeking out some local color, don't miss a morning trip to the fish market adjoining the mosque. This vibrant bartering hub is the perfect opportunity for keen photographers to capture some shots of daily life. Be aware that you'll have to get up early to catch most of the bustling action, and be prepared for quite the malodorous overload. </p>

                <br>
                <p>Bizerte or Bizerta (Arabic: بنزرت‎, romanized: Binzart Tunisian pronunciation: [bɪnzɑrt] (About this soundlisten), Italian: Biserta, French: Bizérte) the classical Hippo, is a town of Bizerte Governorate in Tunisia. It is the northernmost city in Africa, located 65 km (40mil) north of the capital Tunis. It is one of the oldest known settlements in Tunisia, having been founded by settlers from the Phoenician port of Sidon around 1100 BC. Although archaeologists have established that no Phoenician settlements in the West Mediterranean date to before the 9th century bc. It is also known as the last town to remain under French control after the rest of the country won its independence from France. The city had 142,966 inhabitants in 2014.</p>

                        <p>The Bizerte mobile bridge is not the first bridge on the Bizerte canal: a first transporter bridge had already been installed there between 1898 and 1909 before being dismantled and reinstalled in Brest.

When ordering the bridge, Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba would have demanded that it be ordered from the south side, leading to the city of Zarzouna, and not from the north side leading to the city of Bizerte. He would have declared on this occasion: "Thus, even angry with me, the Bizertines will not be able to deny me access to Bizerte!</p>

                        <p> Cave Ichkeul <br>
                       The Ichkeul cave is located in the Jebel Ichkeul, located about twenty kilometres from the city of Bizerte in the National Park Ichkeul covering an area of 12,600 hectares including a lake of 8,500 hectares. Limestone, dolomite, and marble rocks date from Triassic and Jurassic and are located above a collapsed ditch.

The cave itself has a narrow entrance allowing access to a vast room with large cracks along the length of the walls and showing several cavities. The room is followed by a narrow corridor formed by the wall and giant calcitic concretions, which ends with a stack of 32 metres. On the sides of the second room there are draperies, small stalactites and young stalagmites. The cave is well lit and ventilated, and it has a diverse wildlife, including bats, birds and reptiles. </p>

                        <br>
                        <p>The International Festival of Bizerte was founded back in 1983 at the enclosure of the Fort d'Espagne, which has a capacity of 2000 spectators. Its primary was to promote arts and folklore to the Mediterranean region.
                            <br> Later it transformed into an entertainment festival, animated by indigenous artists and a few international stars.</p>
