                    <h2>Medina Tozeur</h2>
                    <p>Tozeur's medina (old town) is the town's main point of interest.

Known as Ouled Hadef, this is the most atmospheric part of Tozeur. Jumbles of higgledy-piggledy lanes ramble through the district, lined with traditional desert houses that sport beautiful decorative brick facades of intricate patterns.

                    <h2>Fort Sidi el Hani</h2>
                    <p>Housed in the Koubba of Sidi Bou Aissa, Tozeur's small Folk Museum (Musée des Arts et Traditions Populaires) is home to a series of exhibits and dioramas that explain the culture and day-to-day life of traditional Tozeur households.

Some of the dioramas themselves are a tad scruffy, but the artisan work on display within them is finely crafted.

There are also rather eclectic collections of Roman columns and fragments of statues on display, as well as local craft products, furnishings, coins, pottery, jewelry, wedding costumes, and Qur'anic inscriptions.</p>

                    <h2>Rebaa Mosque</h2>
                    <p>Tozeur's beautiful date-palm oasis is a serene and tranquil world.

Here, below the shade of outstretched palms, a series of red-dirt paths winds through a wonderland of lush agricultural land. Approximately 400,000 date-palm trees are grown in this vast desert garden.

It's a shady place for a leisurely stroll or cycle ride, and in the late afternoon, donkey and camel rides and horse-drawn carriage tours are offered through the oasis lanes.

The oasis is on the southeast side of Tozeur, accessed off Avenue Abou El Kacem Ech-Chabbi from where a number of small streets run south to the oasis.

Inside the oasis itself are six tiny hamlets that can be visited, the most important of which are Bled el-Hadder, Abbès, and Sahraoui. </p>

                <h2>Know Tozeur History </h2>
                <br>
                <p>During the Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire and in the Vandal Kingdom, Tozeur was the site of Tusuros, in the Roman province of Byzacena (originally part of Africa Proconsularis).
At this time it was the seat of a suffragan bishopric, called Tusuros.

Located in the Sahel hinterland of the Byzacena coastline, close to the towns of Aquae and Nefta and south of Capsa and Ad Turres,Roman Tursuros became an important center of Donatism.

The bishopric ceased to function following the seventh-century arrival of Islam. The remains of an ancient church are visible in the foundations of an old mosque of Tozeur.

Four bishops are historically documented
Bennatus, partook in the Council of Cabarsussi, held in 393 by Maximianists, a sect of dissident Donatists, and signed their acts.
Asellicus, 4th-century bishop, known from correspondence with Augustine of Hippo and Donatian of Reims and from tracts against one Aptus who was accused of Judaising.He attended the Council of Carthage (411) where the prevailing Catholics condemned Donatism as heresy.
Florentinus participated in the Council of Carthage called in 484 by the Arian king Huneric of the Vandal Kingdom, whereafter he was exiled like most Catholic bishops, unlike Aptus, Asellicus' Donatist rival.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>Onk Jemel (Mos Espa)
                            Star Wars fans: Take a deep breath now. Out in the desert, in the area known as Onk Jemel, near Tozeur, is the abandoned film set of Mos Espa surrounded by mammoth dunes.

This is where Anakin Skywalker did his first pod racing in Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace.

It's a bizarre place, with the dome-shaped houses left to slowly wither with age, and other atmospheric pieces from the film set left in place.

You have to travel here by 4WD vehicle, which is an adventure in itself. Most Tozeur tour companies combine a visit here with a bit of dune driving to please those tourists who aren't so enamored with the site's film-buff status.

                        <p> Tozeur Zipline<br>
                       ziplines through the tops of the palm trees at the massive Palmerie at the center of town. For those with a little less adrenaline, it is also a lush and beautiful location to enjoy a peaceful horse and buggy ride. Or take a saunter through the local desert zoo to visit the Coca-Cola-drinking camel and a unique desert garden! As a family of five, who enjoys a good adventure, we highly recommend a family adventure in Tozeur to you! </p>
